# ðŸŒ³ Music

This is a cli tool that uses playerctl to manage an instance of ncspot. I have put into a command branch for inclusion into my c Bonzai stateful command tree.

If you just want to try it out, grab the release binary with curl and put into your PATH:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/tr00datp00nar/music/releases/latest/download/music-linux-amd64 -o ~/.local/bin/music
curl -L https://github.com/tr00datp00nar/music/releases/latest/download/music-darwin-amd64 -o ~/.local/bin/music
curl -L https://github.com/tr00datp00nar/music/releases/latest/download/music-darwin-arm64 -o ~/.local/bin/music
curl -L https://github.com/tr00datp00nar/music/releases/latest/download/music-windows-amd64 -o ~/.local/bin/music
```
